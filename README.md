# ‚ö°EV Station Review App

An interactive MERN stack application that allows users to view and review Electric Vehicle (EV) charging stations on a real-time map interface. The app enables authenticated users to add reviews, assign status (Working, Maintenance, Busy) and vote on others' reviews.

## üöÄ Features
- **Static Login** for quick access (username/password based)
- **Google Maps Integration** to visualize fictitious EV stations
- **Real-Time Updates** using `Socket.IO`
- **User Reviews & Status Updates** for EV stations
- **Upvote/Downvote System** for community engagement
- **Modular Frontend and Backend Architecture**
- **Responsive UI** with intuitive status legends and review modals.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

**Frontend**:
- React.js
- React Router
- Google Maps API
- Socket.IO Client

**Backend**:
- Node.js
- Express.js
- MongoDB (Mongoose)
- Socket.IO
- CORS

## üß™ How to Run Locally
1. **Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Chitraksh27/livecharge.git
cd livecharge
```
2. **Start the Backend**
```bash
cd backend
